# Initiatives
Welcome to the MADE's initiatives page! This document will outline big, public-facing proposals related to the museum's work.

# Mission
**Inspire the next generation of digital creators through playable preservation.**

We differentiate ourselves from other institutions in our belief that the playable experience of video games and other artifacts must be interactive to be fully understood. To that end, our organization actively explores the spectrum of playable preservation by using all available methods to create our exhibit experience.

# Pillars
To effectively distribute our work, our Board of Directors has four primary committees that work alongside a general operations committee. These committees are as follows: Museum, Community, Store, and Education.
