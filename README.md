# Initiatives
Welcome to the MADE's initiatives page! This document will outline big, public-facing proposals related to the museum's work.

# Mission
**Inspire the next generation of digital creators through playable preservation.**

We differentiate ourselves from other institutions in our belief that the playable experience of video games and other artifacts must be interactive to be fully understood. To that end, our organization actively explores the spectrum of playable preservation by using all available methods to create our exhibit experience.

# Pillars
To effectively distribute our work, our Board of Directors has four primary committees that work alongside a general operations committee. These committees are as follows: Museum, Community, Education, and Store. 

- Museum: Maintain and catalog a collection used to produce educational and entertaining playable exhibits at a rapid pace.
- Community: Encourage the gathering of individuals interested in digital expression to learn from one another and create a safe, welcoming space.
- Education: Educate the next generation of digital creators through the critical analysis and creation of digital entertainment media.
- Store: Provide a vehicle for individuals to support the museum’s services while capturing their costs and impact.

# Major Board Initiatives
Many boards approach capacity building by funding a large budget at first. Historically, the museum isn't good at this but, rather, producing value for individuals within community and using that budget to fund the operations of the museum. The museum attracts builders, designers, and people who build and ship real world products.

While this is a weakness, it is also an incredible strength. If we focus, we can build upon our track record of delivering to improve upon the quality of our work and grow budget through the systematic improvement of process. And finally, as a non-profit in the technology space with the ability to draw this talent, we demonstrate the exceptional capacity to innovate to scale.

These board initiatives reflect this approach. Instead of attempting to address all of the different product SKUs and/or focus on big fundraising events, we are going to put our heads down and focus on two goals that will allow us to plan and deploy increasingly engaging events through visual communication, improvement of process, and transparency of costs and impact.

## Unified Digital Double System
Over the past 3 years, spatial visualization, when used, has been the novel mechanism allowing the MADE to communicate and collaborate effectively. It has allowed the museum to reach the final stages of a corporate sponsorship, helped create common understanding between event planners and the museum, sped up exhibit design, demonstrated organizational competence to architects, and determined optimal shelving configurations in the face of building obstructions.

The eventual goal will be to integrate this spatial workflow into as many components of the museum as possible. It will use this system to build exhibits, to educate, to plan, and much more. Most importantly, it will serve as a powerful symbol for how digital creation can build community. 

## Formal Proposal Process
In order to streamline volunteer engagement, individuals within the community must be provided a mechanism through which they can communicate resources needed from the museum, align their goals with the MADE’s, and demonstrate feasibility. The final formal approval process will require completion of a submission form, visuals and/or 3d mockups for space layout or exhibit submissions, and passage through a voting process outlined by volunteers and/or the board.
