# Initiatives
Welcome to the MADE's initiatives page! This document will outline big, public-facing proposals related to the museum's work.

# Mission
**Inspire the next generation of digital creators through playable preservation.**

We differentiate ourselves from other institutions in our belief that the playable experience of video games and other artifacts must be interactive to be fully understood. To that end, our organization actively explores the spectrum of playable preservation by using all available methods to create our exhibit experience.

# Pillars
To effectively distribute our work, our Board of Directors has four primary committees that work alongside a general operations committee. These committees are as follows: Museum, Community, Education, and Store. 

## Museum
Maintain and catalog a collection used to produce educational, playable exhibits at a rapid pace.

## Community
Encourage the gathering of individuals interested in digital expression to learn from one another and create a safe, welcoming space.

## Education
Educate the next generation of digital creators through the critical analysis and creation of digital entertainment media.

## Store
Provide a vehicle for individuals to support the museumâ€™s services while capturing their costs and impact.
