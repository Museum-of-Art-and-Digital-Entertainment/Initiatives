# Digital Double Playable Video Game Museum
In order to scale the operations of the museum, we need a method of communication allowing everyone to come to a common understanding of how objects are laid out in our space. To that end, we are in the process of building a digital double of our museum to improve communication of exhibit proposals, space layout, collections organization, and educational opportunities. Through this digital double system, we will also be able to work with the school district to give students hands-on experience working in 3D game engines, show them how it can be used to accelerate deployment, and provide them a glimpse into how an understanding of video games can help them make change in the real world.

This document is a living/working document that will continue to change and grow as the workflow expands to include more volunteers and features.

## Current Status
Currently, we use Blender with its Collection and Link system in order to separate all of the rooms within the museum so that they can be worked on individually. These are all located within our shared Google Drive inside of `INFR-Design/pipeline/assets`. References are local, so all assets should be correctly linked if you mount the MADE's Google Drive on your machine. If they're not, please reach out over Slack or email so that we can make sure everything works!

## Workflow
TODO. Shem to fill out.
