# Getting Involved at the MADE

When it comes to a museum, there's so much work to be done: expanding a library, maintaining systems, teaching kids how to program, organizing events, and so much more. Through volunteering, you'll also get to meet folks passionate about games, technology, and art. And we always try to know how we can make volunteering fulfill your own personal or professional goals as well.

To get involved, swing by 921 Washington Street on Mondays at 6pm for our volunteer meeting. Or you can send an email to info@themade.org to learn more. Check out our Event Calendar for more info. We look forward to working with you!

Not in the Bay Area? We need help online too! Check out our projects page here, and comment on an issue that you'd like to work on! We've got a bunch of web development work, as well as projects involving MMO restoration and digital preservation efforts.
